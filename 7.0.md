## 7.1

You should design a Theme Park application.
It needs to model rides, stalls, employees and customers.

Now, declare all the classes you would need and declare all the functions you
would need for the application to make sense. Should a ride be able to have
passengers? Is employee and customer the same thing? What differentiates a ride
from a stall? Ask yourself all of these questions and more while you decalre and
only declare your methods and classes.

## 7.2

When you feel that you are done declaring all of your needed classes and methods
switch your code with your partner and begin implementing her application!

This means that you are not allowed to make any changes to the declerations of
the methods or the classes before having discussed it with the declarator.
