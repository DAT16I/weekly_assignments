# 2.0

## 2.1
Given a string name, e.g. "Bob", return a greeting in the form "Hello Bob!".

helloName("Bob") → "Hello Bob!"

helloName("Alice") → "Hello Alice!"

helloName("X") → "Hello X!"
```java
public String helloName(String name) {
  
}
```

## 2.2
Given a string of even length, return the first half. So the string "WooHoo" yields "Woo".

firstHalf("WooHoo") → "Woo"

firstHalf("HelloThere") → "Hello"

firstHalf("abcdef") → "abc"

```java
public String firstHalf(String str) {
  
}
```

## 2.3
Given a string, if the first or last chars are 'x', return the string without those 'x' chars, and otherwise return the string unchanged.

withoutX("xHix") → "Hi"

withoutX("xHi") → "Hi"

withoutX("Hxix") → "Hxi"

```java
public String withoutX(String str) {
  
}
```

## 2.4
Given two strings, append them together (known as "concatenation") and return the result. However, if the concatenation creates a double-char, then omit one of the chars, so "abc" and "cat" yields "abcat".

conCat("abc", "cat") → "abcat"

conCat("dog", "cat") → "dogcat"

conCat("abc", "") → "abc"

```java
public String conCat(String a, String b) {
  
}
```

## 2.5
Start a new project. You have to create an `Animal`, `Dog` and `Cat` class.
`Dog`and `Cat` has to inherit from `Animal`.

Animals have:
* Name
* Age
* Color

Animals can:
* Walk
* Poop

Dogs have:
* Tag

Dogs can:
* Do cute stuff

Cats have:
* Chip

Cats can:
* Be irritating

__To Do__
* Now, I need a single list of all the dogs and cats in my house. I got 4 dogs and 3 cats. 

* I want to be able to read about all the animals in my house in a printout that gives me their
basic animal info and adds either their chip number or their tag name at the end.

* I want all the dogs to be walked for 10km and all the cats to be walked for 500m.

* Then I want you to on the basis of the list sort out all the irritating ones and keep the cute ones.
