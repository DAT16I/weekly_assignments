## 5.1

Make three classes/files. one should be called Attendee another Party and the last Main.

### Attendee

```java
public class Attendee {

	private String name;
	private int age;
	private double height;

	public Attendee(String name, int age, double height) {
	
		this.name = name;
		this.age = age;
	    this.height = height;	

	}

	//Don't change anything above this line
	
	//Implement getters and setters

}

```

### Party

```java
public class Party {
    
    private Attendee partyHost;
	private String partyType;
	private ArrayList<Attendee> attendees;
    
    //"Finish" the constructor
	public Party(ArrayList<Attendee> attendees) {
	
		this.attendees = attendees;	

	}
	
	public void setPartyHost(Attendee partyHost) {
	    this.partyHost = partyHost;
	}
	
	public Attendee getPartyHost() {
	    return this.partyHost;
	}
	
	//Finish the rest of the getters and setters
	
	public Attendee getOldest() {
	    ArrayList<Attendee> attendees = this.attendess;
	    //Finish the rest yourself.
	    
	}
	
	public Attendee getTallest() {
        ArrayList<Attendee> attendees = this.attendess;
    	//Finish the rest yourself.
    	    
    }
    
    public int getAgeSum() {
        ArrayList<Attendee> attendees = this.attendess;
        //Finish the rest yourself.
        	    
    }

}

```

### Main

```java
public class Main {
	
	public void main(String[] args) {
		
		ArrayList<Attendee> attendees = new ArrayList<>();
		attendees.add(new Attendee("Andrew Ender Wiggin", 15, 1.86));
		attendees.add(new Attendee("Valentine Wiggin", 30, 1.86));
		attendees.add(new Attendee("Mazer Rackham", 45, 1.16));
		attendees.add(new Attendee("Bean", 11, 1.10));
		attendees.add(new Attendee("Dink", 20, 2.0));
		
		//Don't change above this line
		
		Party birthdayParty = new Party(attendees);
		

	}
	
}
```

Now add getters and setters and finish the missing part of the Party constructor.

## 5.2

People arrive at the party but are a bit confused as to who is the actual host of the party.
Finish the code in `Party` and set a host of the party in `Main`.

## 5.3

The attendee Dink has not even gotten in the door before he is kicked out. He is too tall to be at birthday parties.
Remove Dink from the `attendees` ArrayList and make sure that Dink is not still in the `party`.

## 5.4

You are trying to figure out who of you guys is the oldest among you at the party.
Go to the `getOldest` function in `Party` and finish it.

## 5.5

You guys figured out who was the oldest among you, but now you wanna find out who is the tallest. There can only be one!
Go to the `getTallest` function in `Party` and finish it.

## 5.6 

All of this math at a birthday party has become tiresome but you really wan't to know how old all of you guys are summed.
Go to the `getAgeSum` function in `Party` and finish it.
