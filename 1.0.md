# 1.0

## 1.1
Given two int values, return their sum. Unless the two values are the same, then return double their sum.
```java
public int sumDouble(int firstNumber, int secondNumber) {

}
```

## 1.2
Given an int inputNumber, return the absolute difference between inputNumber and 41, except return double the absolute difference if inputNumber is over 41.
```java
public int diff41(int inputNumber) {

}
```

## 1.3
We have a loud barking dog. The "hour" parameter is the current hour time in the range 0..23. We are in trouble if the dog is barking and the hour is before 8 or after 21. Return true if we are in trouble.
```java
public boolean dogTrouble(boolean barking, int hour) {

}
```

## 1.4
Given 2 ints, firstNumber and secondNumber, return true if one if them is 30 or if their sum is 30.
```java
public boolean makes30(int firstNumber, int secondNumber) {

}
```

## 1.5
Given a string, return a new string where "not " has been added to the front. However, if the string already begins with "not", return the string unchanged. Note: Look up substring()
```java
public String notString(String textToCheck) {

}
```
